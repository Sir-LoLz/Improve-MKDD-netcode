# Improve-MKDD-netcode

So a very underrated feature for Mario Kart Double Dash is itâ€™s LAN mode. As one of the few of us who have played it I can attest that it is a blast to play and has a charm about it that later entries in the Mario Kart franchise have yet to match. 

Using Xlink Kai it is possible to tunnel the game over the internet. However the Netcode was not designed with this in mind and has a tendency to crash. And even if it does not crash it will run in slow motion due to the lockstep nature of it. This is a great shame to an otherwise great game. 

I made this Github post so I can post a bounty to fix the issue. My desire is to see a fix developed that can be patched to a Legally dumped ISO file that will remove the crashes that happen during menu transitions and remove the slowdown that happens during the race. Whether this is with AR codes, code patches, or other does not matter as long as the issues are fixed.
